## requirements

To use the CLI you'll need NodeJS installed

### prepare the executable

Install the dev dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

link the `fox` executable:

```sh
ln -s ~/Projects/uralys/gamedev/fox/cli/cli.js /usr/local/bin/fox
```

You may have to reload your termilnal to have `fox` in your path;

You can now execute fox commands from your terminal:

```sh
fox
```

You can pass parameters to Godot by using them directly from the command line:

```sh
fox run:game --headless
```

## usage

```ini

  fox run:editor              open Godot Editor with your main scene
